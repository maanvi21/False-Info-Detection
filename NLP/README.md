# Fake News Detection

In the era of digital information, the spread of fake news has become a significant concern, affecting public opinion and decision-making. To combat this, our project aims to develop a web-based application for detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The final product will not only help users verify the authenticity of news articles but also contribute to the broader effort of mitigating the impact of misinformation in society.
